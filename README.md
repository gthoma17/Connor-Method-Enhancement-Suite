Connor Method Enhancement Suite
===============================
This extension simplifies Connor's method of gaming the Linkdin ranking system.

Connor likes to go to popular articles and open the profile of everyone who has commented

This prompts some of the viewed people to view his profile thus increasing his ranking

This extension automatically opens all links on a the active page which match a regex

The default value for this regex is .*linkdin.com/profile.* to get you started

But it can be set to any value by accessing the extension's settings
