This prompts some of the viewed people to view his profile thus increasing his ranking

This extension automatically opens all links on a the active page which match a regex

There is a configuarable delay between each tab opening to prevent LinkedIn from locking you out

The default value for this regex is https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=.* to get you started

But it can be set to any value by accessing the extension's settings
